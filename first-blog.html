  <h1>Why I’m Skipping +2 to Learn Computer Science and Build My Future</h1>
  <p class="meta">Written by Kabir Nahata · July 2025</p>

  <p>I’m Kabir, a 16-year-old from Nepal who recently completed SEE. Instead of joining a traditional +2 program, I’ve chosen to self-study computer science and build a future rooted in curiosity, skill, and real-world learning. It’s an unusual and risky path — but I believe it’s the right one for me.</p>

  <h2>Why I Chose to Self-Study</h2>
  <p>I chose this path because traditional education never felt aligned with my goals. Most schools don’t give students the freedom to explore what truly excites them. I used to wonder: <em>When will we learn how to communicate, solve real problems, or build something meaningful?</em> As a teenager with a curious mind and an interest in financial independence, I often felt school missed out on teaching us what life demands outside textbooks.</p>

  <p>My passion for computers, my desire to learn practical skills, and the freedom to direct my own education pushed me toward self-study. I’m not against education itself — I just believe there are multiple ways to learn. This is the one that helps me stay true to myself.</p>

  <h2>What I’ve Done So Far</h2>
  <p>So far, I’ve completed two courses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stanford Code in Place 2025</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification</strong> (by Andrew Ng, DeepLearning.AI)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I’m also close to completing <strong>CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science</strong> from Harvard.</p>

    <li>🔗 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabirnahata" target="_blank">LinkedIn: Kabir Nahata</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What’s Next</h2>
  <p>For the next two years, I’m planning to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dive deeper into <strong>AI, machine learning, and data science</strong></li>
    <li>Prepare for <strong>SAT, TOEFL, and GED</strong></li>
    <li>Build my <strong>personal website and blog</strong></li>
    <li>Create a <strong>public profile and project portfolio</strong></li>
    <li>Eventually apply to <strong>top research-focused universities abroad</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This journey is not easy — I’ve felt stuck, uncertain, and overwhelmed many times. But the support of my family and the excitement of discovering new things keep me going. This blog is where I’ll share my learning journey, my ups and downs, and everything I create along the way.</p>

  <p>Thanks for reading,  
  <br>— <strong>Kabir</strong></p>
